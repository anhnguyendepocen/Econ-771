## Main Resources
To get the most out of this class, we need to use a handful of tools. Some of these may be new to you (I'm still learning too!), but I've selected all of these resources deliberately. They should complement each other and build relevant skills for any applied empirical economics researcher.

1. **Canvas**: This is where I'll post announcements, grades, and other information only for this class (such as Zoom meeting links).

2. **OneNote**: Everyone will soon receive an invitation to join our OneNote classroom. This will provide you with your own notebook for the class, where you can take your own notes and have access to all of my annotated notes from class. Note that all of the notes (without annotation) will also be available below in the Module links.

3. **GitHub**: Everyone will soon receive an invitation to join our GitHub classroom. This is where you can access code files and datasets (where possible) and organize all of your code for class assignments. This is also how you will submit your assignments. If you're not familiar with GitHub, take a look at the excellent notes from [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/) and his class, [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures).

4. **Amazon Web Services**: Everyone will have access to cloud computing through AWS. This will serve as your own virtual computer, so we all have the same data capabilities, versions, and packages. You don't have to use this, but for those of you with limited computing power, this is an easy solution.

5. **Zoom**: All office hours and one-on-one meetings will take place virtually in our private Zoom meeting room. Details of the room are available on *Canvas*.

6. **GroupTweet**: We'll use GroupTweet to facilitate discussions outside of normal class time. I'll set up the group and it will act as our own private Twittersphere.

7. **Me!** Please reach out to me for any reason. I will answer emails as promptly as possible (definitely within 24 hours), and we can meet virtually whenever I am available. If you'd like to meet virtually, just go to [https://ian-meetings.youcanbook.me](https://ian-meetings.youcanbook.me) and find a time that works.


## Data
We'll come across the following datasets throughout the course. Some of these link to GitHub repositories that I and others have put together to help with some of the larger, more cumbersome data endeavors. Others are just direct links to the downloadable data on the CMS or NBER websites. This is a long list...the goal is not for you to all use each of these datasets in detail in this class. Rather, the goal is that you have some understanding of the available public use datasets for studying supply-side issues in U.S. healthcare. We'll use a subset of these datasets in our exercises for each module.
