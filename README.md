This is a PhD course in Health Economics, taught by [Ian McCarthy](http://ianmccarthyecon.com) at Emory University. Before going much further, please be sure to read the full [syllabus](syllabus/syllabus-771.pdf), which provides more details on class policies and learning objectives.

## Course Objectives

I have five central goals for this course:

1. Synthesize the current literature in each of the main areas of health economics covered in this class

2. Apply standard causal inference techniques in the area of healthcare

3. Provide constructive criticism of academic work in this area

4. Organize real-world data with up-to-date workflow and versioning tools

5. Develop your own preliminary research in some area of health economics

There are more specific learning outcomes for each module described on the relevant module's page of our class website, accessible [here](https://imccart.github.io/Econ-771/module-guides/).



## Acknowledgements
This class (and in particular the *R Markdown* formatting and animations) have benefitted significantly from several people who have been generous enough to make their website and other programs available to the public. Some of those people include:

1. [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/) at the University of Oregon. His *GitHub* repository for [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) offers a wealth of information.

2. [Nick Huntington-Klein](http://nickchk.com/) at CSU Fullerton. His causal inference animations are hugely helpful, in addition to the notes for his causal inference class. All of this information is available at his website.

3. [Adam Sacarny](http://sacarny.com/) at Columbia University. He has some great hospital data made available through several *GitHub* respositories, this includes repositories for [HCRIS Data](https://github.com/asacarny/hospital-cost-reports) and [Provider of Services Data](https://github.com/asacarny/provider-of-services).

4. [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/) has some incredible resources for people learning *R* and *GitHub*. Her and Jim Hester's [Happy Git and GitHub with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a great reference.

5. [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com/) genrously posted his `R Markdown` syllabus template, which I'm using for this class as well.
