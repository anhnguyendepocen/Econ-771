# Econ 771: Health Economics II

This is a PhD course in Health Economics, taught by [Ian McCarthy](http://ianmccarthyecon.com) at Emory University. Before going much further, please be sure to read the full [syllabus](syllabus/syllabus-771.pdf), which provides more details on class policies and learning objectives. 

This ReadMe file is the landing page for our class website. Below, I provide details on resources, course logistics, assignments, and the course schedule. This site is very much a work-in-progress, so be sure to check back regularly for updates. Better yet, you can clone the repo via *Git* and then pull regularly to get updates. If you're not familiar with GitHub, take a look at the excellent notes from [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/) and his class, [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures). 

## Main Resources

To get the most out of this class, we need to use a handful of tools. Some of these may be new to you (I'm still learning too!), but I've selected all of these resources deliberately. They should complement each other and build relevant skills for any applied economics researcher.

1. **Canvas**: This is where I'll post announcements and any grades. We'll also use Canvas for our discussion forums.

2. **OneNote**: Everyone will soon receive an invitation to join our OneNote classroom. This will provide you with your own notebook for the class, where you can take your own notes and have access to all of my annotated notes from class. Note that all of the notes (without annotation) are also available below.

3. **GitHub**: Everyone will also soon receive an invitation to join our GitHub classroom. This is where you can access all code files and datasets that we'll use in the class. This is also how you will submit your main replication project.

4. **Amazon Web Services**: Everyone will have access to cloud computing through AWS. This will serve as your own virtual computer, so we all have the same data capabilities, versions, and packages.

5. **Zoom**: All office hours and one-on-one meetings will take place virtually in our private Zoom meeting room. Details of the room are available on *Canvas*.

6. **Me!** Please reach out to me for any reason. I will answer emails as promptly as possible (definitely within 24 hours), and we can meet virtually whenever I am available. If you'd like to meet virtually, just go to [https://ian-meetings.youcanbook.me](https://ian-meetings.youcanbook.me) and find a time that works.



## Notes and Slides
Below are all of the slides and other resources relevant for each class. The slides will open as html files. Be sure to check the *OneNote* notebook for any annotated notes from each class, accessible via our *OneNote classroom*. 


0. Motivation and expectations for the class

Today we'll just introduce ourselves and I'll give you my pitch for why I think health economics is an exciting and important area to study.


1. The hospital objective function and financial incentives


2. Physician agency and treatment decisions


3. Information disclosure


4. Mergers and healthcare competition


5. Key issues for health insurance markets





## Assignments
1. GitHub and Data Management, Due 2/9, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-01.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-01-answers.html)\]

2. HCRIS Data and Hospital Pricing, Due 3/2, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-02.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-02-answers.html)\]

3. Smoking Data and Cigarette Demand, Due 3/25, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-03.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-03-answers.html)\]
  - [Zoom Class Homework Review, March 30](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lrxqC-AACSlHyHBywWx5BaO-mkY8rZTa)

4. Quality and Insurance Choice, Due 4/8, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-04.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-04-answers.html)\]

5. Medicaid Expansion and Uninsurance Rates, Due 4/22, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-05.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-05-answers.html)\]. Some people have had issues retrieving the data using an API key. The ACS data are available [here](data/insurance.rds) as an `R` data set and [here](data/insurance.txt) as a tab-delimited text file. These data are the same as the "final.insurance" object in the GitHub repo.

6. Research Project, Final Paper Due 5/4, \[[Instructions](assignments/project.html)\]


## GitHub Repositories
We'll use the following GitHub repositories throughout the course. Each repo deals with a different group of datasets.

1. [Medicare Advantage](https://github.com/imccart/Medicare-Advantage)

2. [HCRIS](https://github.com/imccart/HCRIS)

3. [CDC Tax Burden on Tobacco](https://github.com/imccart/CDC-Tobacco)

4. [ACS and Medicaid Expansion](https://github.com/imccart/Insurance-Access)


## Acknowledgements
This class (and in particular the *R Markdown* formatting and animations) have benefitted significantly from several people who have been generous enough to make their website and other programs available to the public. Some of those people include:

1. [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/) at the University of Oregon. His *GitHub* repository for [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) offers a wealth of information.

2. [Nick Huntington-Klein](http://nickchk.com/) at CSU Fullerton. His causal inference animations are hugely helpful, in addition to the notes for his causal inference class. All of this information is available at his website.

3. [Adam Sacarny](http://sacarny.com/) at Columbia University. He has some great hospital data made available through several *GitHub* respositories, this includes repositories for [HCRIS Data](https://github.com/asacarny/hospital-cost-reports) and [Provider of Services Data](https://github.com/asacarny/provider-of-services).

4. [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/) has some incredible resources for people learning *R* and *GitHub*. Her and Jim Hester's [Happy Git and GitHub with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a great reference.
