## Assignments
There are four main assignments throughout the semester, along with a participation component. More information on each assignment is listed below. Note that I **do not** expect or want anyone to treat these assignments as entirely separate. By that, I mean you should try to identify datasets from the exercises that you can use in your replication project, and you should try to select papers to present that use those data. At a minimum, you should present the paper that you will be replicating. With a little bit of up-front planning, you can create a lot of overlap across assignments, which will make your life much easier. 

1. **Discussion**: Participation in our online discussions is a small portion of the grade. This is particulary important in our virtual classroom setting. The goal is just to incentivize you all to participate in this discussion outside of class. Your grade will be based on 10 possible discussion forums/topics. 

2. **Empirical exercises**: Each course module will have an applied component where we spend some time replicating analyses from selected papers based on real-world data. These will require some of your time outside of class to get the data in working order and implement the relevant identification strategy and econometric estimator. This empirical work should heavily complement your replication project as well as your draft paper. All exercises will be assigned through GitHub classroom and will come with clear instructions on the general research question, data sources, and estimation strategies. Details of each empirical exercise are in the following links:
  - [Exercise 1](exercise1.html): Basics of causal inference with panel data; get some experience using the inpatient prospective payment system final rule files, the provider of services files, and the hospital cost report data.
  - [Exercise 2](exercise2.html): Instrumental variables
  - [Exercise 3](exercise3.html): Regression Discontinuity
  - [Exercise 4](exercise4.html): Hospital markets and demand estimation

3. **Presentations**: You will present two papers throughout the course of the semester. A list of potential papers and other instructions is available on the [presentations](presentation.html) page of our class website. Please inform me of your selected papers no later than **August 21, 2020**.

4. **Literature review** (2nd year) or **draft paper** (3rd year): You will prepare a literature review or a preliminary draft paper depending on how far along you are in the PhD program. Details of these assignments are available on the [literature review](lit-review.html) and [draft paper](draft-paper.html) pages of our website. This assignment is due by **Friday, November 13, 2020**.

5. **Replication**: You will replicate a published paper using publicly available data. Details of this assignment and a list of potential papers to replicate are available on the [replication](replication.html) page of our class website. You can also choose to replicate a paper off of the list, but I must approve any selection by **Friday, September 4, 2020**. Your final replication is due no later than **Friday, December 11, 2020** (the day of our scheduled final exam).
