# Overview
In this assignment, we're going to work through some applied issues related to measuring hospital markets and estimating demand with market-level data.

To begin, please "accept" the assignment on our GitHub classroom page. This will initialize a GitHub repository where you can edit and ultimately craft your answers in your data management/econometrics software of choice.  

You will "turn in" your repository to me with your answers and all supporting documents. Please create a final document with your main answers and analyses in a PDF. Please also be sure to include in your repository all of your supporting code files. Practice writing good code and showing me only what I would need to recreate your results.


# Resources and data
The data for this assignment comes from three sources:

1. **HCRIS**: All hospitals that treat Medicare patients must submit a hospital cost report. The data are then made available on the CMS website. The NBER also provides a slightly more user-friendly version of these data. Info and code for these data are available at my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/imccart/HCRIS). The raw data are available on our AWS AMI in the "HCRIS" folder.

2. **Provider of Services files**: These data are available from [NBER POS](https://data.nber.org/data/provider-of-services.html) as well as at [Adam Sacarny's GitHub repo](https://github.com/asacarny/provider-of-services). I've also made these data available on our shared AWS AMI in the "POS" folder. Use these data to get information on hospital ownership type.

3. **Hospital Market GitHub Repo**: John Graves has an excellent GitHub repository detailing the issues in measuring hospital markets. You can access that reop [here](https://github.com/graveja0/health-care-markets).


# Questions
In your GitHub repository, please be sure to clearly address/answer the following questions.

1. Calculate hospital market shares when defining the "market" as a hospital's zip code and using hospital beds as your measure of quantity. Create a "violin plot" of market shares over time.

2. Calculate hospital market shares when defining the "market" as the HRR, again using hospital beds as your measure of quantity. Create a violin plot of market shares over time. How do these results differ from part 1?

3. Calculate hospital market shares when defining the market based on the community detection algorithms described [here](https://github.com/graveja0/health-care-markets). Continue to use hospital beds as your measure of quantity, and summarize your results with a violin plot. How do these results differ from those in parts 1 and 2?

4. Estimate a nested logit discrete choice model using market share data based on the different definition of markets in parts 1-3. What is your price elasticity estimate in each case, and how does it differ based on your measure of the market? *hint: don't worry about instrumenting for anything right now.*
