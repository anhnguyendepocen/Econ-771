# Overview
In this assignment, we're going to work through some applied issues related to measuring hospital markets and examining the effects of market power.

To begin, please "accept" the assignment on our GitHub classroom page. This will initialize a GitHub repository where you can edit and ultimately craft your answers in your data management/econometrics software of choice.  

You will "turn in" your repository to me with your answers and all supporting documents. Please create a final document with your main answers and analyses in a PDF. Please also be sure to include in your repository all of your supporting code files. Practice writing good code and showing me only what I would need to recreate your results.
