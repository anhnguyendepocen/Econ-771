# Fixed Prices

- Demand: $q_{j}=s_{j}(z_{j}) \times D(\bar{p})$
- Costs: $c_{j}=c(q_{j},z_{j}) + F$
- Profits: $\pi_{j} = \bar{p}q_{j} - c_{j}$

<br>
--
Hospitals choose quality such that: $$\frac{\partial \pi_{j}}{\partial z_{j}} = \left(\bar{p} - \frac{\partial c_{j}}{\partial q_{j}} \right)\left(\frac{\partial s_{j}}{\partial z_{j}}D + s_{j}\frac{\partial D}{\partial z_{j}} \right) - \frac{\partial c_{j}}{\partial z_{j}}=0$$

---
count: false

# Fixed Prices

- Increase in competition will tend to increase quality
- Negative welfare effects if $\frac{\partial D}{\partial z_{j}}$ is sufficiently small and fixed costs are large


---
count: false

# Fixed Prices

Alternative expression for quality: $$z_{j} = \left(\bar{p} - c_{q} \right) \left(\eta_{s} + \eta_{D} \right) \frac{D s_{j}}{c_{z}}$$

- Quality increasing in $\bar{p}$
- Quality increasing in share and demand elasticities
- Quality increase in overall market share and market demand
- Quality decreasing in marginal cost


---
# Market Prices

Profit given by $\pi = q(p,z) \times (p-c-d\times z) - F,$ which yields
\begin{align*}
  p &= \frac{\epsilon_{p}}{\epsilon_{p}-1} (c+dz) \\
  z &= \frac{\epsilon_{z}}{\epsilon_{z}+1} \frac{p-c}{d}
\end{align*}


---
count: false

# Market Prices

Rewrite in terms of elasticities:
\begin{align*}
  \epsilon_{p} &= \frac{p}{p-c-dz} \\
  \epsilon_{z} &= \frac{dz}{p - c - dz}
\end{align*}

<br>
--

Taking the ratio and solving for $z$ yields, $$z = \frac{p}{d}\times \frac{\epsilon_{z}}{\epsilon_{p}}.$$    

---
count: false

# Market Prices

$$z = \frac{p}{d}\times \frac{\epsilon_{z}}{\epsilon_{p}}$$    

Dorfman-Steiner condition:
- Quality increases if the quality elasticity increases or if price increases
- Quality increases if the price elasticity decreases or the marginal cost of quality decreases

**Prediction for competition:** Hospitals will compete on whatever matters most to patients.

# Bargaining

Gowrisankaran, Nevo, and Town extend the Nash bargaining framework to consider a hospital-insurer negotiation. They propose a two-stage bargaining process:
1. Hospitals and insurers negotiate over the terms of their agreement (network inclusion and prices)
2. Individuals receive "health draws" which dictate their healthcare needs

<br>
--
*Bargaining occurs over a base price, not specific to each procedure*

---
count: false

# Bargaining

- Total expected cost to the insurer, $TC_{m}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m})$ 
- Willingness to pay to have access to hospital, $W_{m}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m})$
- Total payoff for the MCO is $$V_{m}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m}) = \tau W_{m}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m}) - TC_{m}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m}),$$ where $\tau$ is the relative weight placed on employee/patient welfare
- Net value that MCO $m$ receives from including hospital $j$ in its network is then $V_{m}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\vec{p}_{m})$.

---
count: false

# Bargaining

In the case of a single hospital system, and denoting hospital $j$'s marginal cost for services provided to patients in MCO $m$ is given by $mc_{mj}$, the overall profit for hospital $j$ for a given set of MCO contracts (denoted $M_{s}$), is $$\pi_{j}\left(M_{s},\{\vec{p}_{m}\}_{m\in M_{s}} \right)=\sum_{m\in M_{s}} q_{mj}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m}) \left[p_{mj} - mc_{mj} \right].$$


---
count: false

# Bargaining

The authors then derive the Nash bargaining solution as the choice of prices maximizing the exponentiated product of the net value from agreement:
\begin{align*}
NB^{m,j} \left(p_{mj} | \vec{p}_{m,-j}\right) &= \left(q_{mj}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m}) \left[p_{mj} - mc_{mj} \right]\right)^{b_{j(m)}} \\
& \times \left(V_{m}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\vec{p}_{m})\right)^{b_{m(j)}},
\end{align*}
where $b_{j(m)}$ is the bargaining weight of hospital $j$ when facing MCO $m$, $b_{m(j)}$ is the bargaining weight of MCO $m$ when facing hospital $j$, and $\vec{p}_{m,-j}$ is the vector of prices for MCO $m$ and hospitals other than $j$. We can normalize bargaining weight such that $b_{j(m)} + b_{m(j)} = 1$.

---
count: false

# Bargaining

Taking the natural log, the resulting first order condition yields: 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \ln (NB^{m,s})}{\partial p_{mj}} =& b_{s(m)} \frac{q_{mj} + \frac{\partial q_{mj}}{\partial p_{mj}} \left[p_{mj}-mc_{mj}\right]}{q_{mj}\left[p_{mj}-mc_{mj}\right]} \\
& + b_{m(j)} \frac{\frac{\partial V_{m}}{\partial p_{mj}}}{V_{m}(N_{m},\vec{p}_{m})-V_{m}(N_{m,-j},\vec{p}_{m})} = 0
\end{align*}

---
count: false

# Bargaining

Simplifying and rewriting, we get: $$p_{mj} - mc_{mj} = -q_{mj} \left(\frac{\partial q_{mj}}{\partial p_{mj}} + q_{mj} \times \frac{b_{m(j)}}{b_{j(m)}} \times \frac{\frac{\partial V_{m}}{\partial p_{mj}}}{\triangle V_{m}} \right)^{-1}$$

- $\triangle V_{m}$ is positive by construction
- Can show that $\frac{\partial V_{m}}{\partial p_{mj}}<0$ under most conditions

Bargaining tends to increase the "effective" price sensitivity and reduce hospital margins relative to standard pricing conditions (but not always)

---
count: false

# Bargaining

- Price response to other changes depends largely on $\frac{\partial V_{m}}{\partial p_{mj}}$
- Can be expressed as: $$-q_{mj}-\alpha \sum_{i}\sum_{d}\gamma_{id}c_{id}(1-c_{id}) \left(\sum_{k\in N_{m}} p_{mk}s_{ikd} - p_{mj}\right),$$ where $\gamma_{id}$ includes several terms including disease weights and probability of disease. 

---
count: false

# Bargaining
$$-q_{mj}-\alpha \sum_{i}\sum_{d}\gamma_{id}c_{id}(1-c_{id}) \left(\sum_{k\in N_{m}} p_{mk}s_{ikd} - p_{mj}\right),$$

- $c_{id}$ denotes the coinsurance rate
- final term is the difference between hospital $j$'s price and the weighted average price of all other hospitals (weighted by their market share)
- $c_{id}\times (1-c_{id})$ shows role of coinsurance in steering patients to different hospitals

# Key Issues

1. Measuring competitiveness
2. Reduced form - mergers, closures, structure-conduct-performance
3. Structural estimation with bargaining models


---
# Measuring competitiveness
- Common measure is Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), $\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_{i}^{2}$.
  - 2,500 is considered **highly concentrated**
  - 1,800 is considered **unconcentrated**
- "Willingness to pay" is more recent measure (theoretically supported)
- Both require a measure of the geographic market

---
# Defining the market
Lots of subjectivity...
- Radius around a hospital?
- Concentric circles to define "catchment" areas?
- Patient/physician referrals?
- At what product-level do hospitals compete?

---
# Trends in competitiveness
Almost any way you define it, hospital markets are more and more concentrated (less competitive) in recent decades.
- 1990: 65% of MSAs highlgy concentrated, 23% unconcentrated
- 2006: 77% highly concentrated, 11% unconcentrated

# Hospital concentration over time
- More data and [interactive report](https://www.healthcostinstitute.org/research/hmi/hmi-interactive#HMI-Concentration-Index) from the Health Care Cost Institute.
- [Presentation](https://www.nihcm.org/topics/health-care-delivery/hospital-consolidation-trends-impacts-outlook) from the National Institute for Health Care Management

---
# Why?
Historical perception of hospital competition as "wasteful" and assumption that more capacity means more (unnecessary) care:
- Limit public spending by limiting competition
- Prevalence of certificate of need (CON) laws

---
# Effects of reduced competition
1. Higher prices
2. Lower quality, [2020 NEJM Paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1901383)
3. Maybe lower costs (but not passed on to lower prices)<br>
