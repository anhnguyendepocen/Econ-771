# Wasteful?
- Estimates are that more than 30% of health care expenditures are "wasteful": [(The Atlantic, 2013)](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/youre-getting-too-much-healthcare/281896/)

- Some clear areas of waste:
  - Payment differentials by location of treatment (policy quirks)
  - Better imaging with little benefit
  - Proton treatment (for some conditions)
  - Heart stents
  - Arthroscopic knee surgery<br>


--

Many estimates of "waste" are after-the-fact. It's actually very hard to identify waste before-hand. [Report on End-of-life Spending](http://news.mit.edu/2018/value-late-life-health-care-spending-medicare-0628)

# Physician Agency

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=1055px></html>

---
# Definition

Physicians are better informed about treatment decisions than patients, and so there exists some <b>agency</b> relationship between the two. For many conditions, patients can't treat themselves even if they wanted to.

<br>

Role of physicians: 

- [Gaynor, Propper, and Seiler (2016)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20121532)
- [Chernew, et al (2019)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24869)

# Setup

- Denote quantity of physician services by $x$
- Denote benefit of services to patient by $B(x)$
- Patients pay (and physicians receive) a price of $p$ for each unit of service $x$
- Physicians incur cost $c$ for each unit of care
- Net benefit to patients is $NB(x)=B(x)-px$
- Physicians must choose quantity of care at least better than the patient's outside option, $NB(x)= B(x)-px \geq NB^{0}$.


---
# Solving the model
With this framework, how much care will be provided? What is the optimal value of $x$?


---
count: false

# Solving the model

Solve the model in two steps:<br>

1. Physician will provide minimum surplus to keep the patient, $NB(x) = B(x)-px = NB^{0}$

2. Substitute into physician profit function, $$\pi=(p-c)x = B(x)-NB^{0} - cx,$$ and solve for $x$<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup>This approach applies when prices and quantity of care are variable. If the physician cannot set price, then we just work off of the constraint, $B(x)-\bar{p}x=NB^{0}$.

# Example with fixed price
An increase in the administratively set price leads to a <b>decrease</b> in quantity of services provided. And vice versa, a reduction in price leads to an <b>increase</b> in quantity provided. Why?

--
$$\begin{align*}
b(x)\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}p} - x - p\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}p} &= 0 \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}p} = \frac{-x}{p-b(x)} &< 0.
\end{align*}$$

# Agency with capitated payments

- Physician receives fixed ("capitated") amount for each patient, $R$, along with some price per unit of service, $p_{s}$

- Physician therefore paid $R + (p_{s} - c)x$ for each patient

- Number of patients for each physician expressed as a positive function of the net benefit offered, $n(NB)$, where $NB=B(x) - p_{d}x$. Here, we assume that the insurer sets $p_{d}$ and $p_{s}$ separately (the demand and supply price, respectively).

- Physician again aims to maximize profits, $\pi=n(NB)\left[R+(p_{s}-c)x\right]$.


---
# Solution with capitated payments
Maximizing the profit function yields:<br>
$n'(NB)(B'(x) - p_{d}) \left[R + (p_{s} - c)x \right] + n(NB)(p_{s}-c) = 0$.<br>

Rearranging terms and multiplying both sides by $\frac{1}{NB}$, we get:<br>
$\frac{B'(x) - p_{d}}{NB} \frac{R + (p_{s} - c)x}{p_{s}-c} = - \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n,NB}}$

--

1. What happens for $R=0$?
2. What about $R>0$, assuming $p_{s}<c$?
